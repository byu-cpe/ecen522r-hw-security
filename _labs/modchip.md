The objective of this experiment is to simulate a Modchip attack towards a system that is protected by a key.



## Preliminary

### System Overview

The figure below shows a simplified schematic view of the Microcontroller and Flash memory which provides key to the system. Modchipping this FLASH will cause the system to get a different key (usually a more powerful key). In this experiment, we will change the key data that is communicated through the SPI bus without replacing the FLASH memory. We can force the data on the MISO wire to different values by connecting the Modchip soldering point (please find on P2 or P9) to another source. To make things simpler, weâ€™ll short it to ground in this experiment.

### About Modchip Attacks

A Modchip is a small electronic device used to alter or disable artificial restrictions of computers or entertainment devices. Modchips are mainly used in video game consoles, DVD players, TV cables, etc. They introduce various modifications to its host system's function, including the circumvention of region coding, digital rights management, and copy protection checks for the purpose of using media intended for other markets, copied media, or unlicensed third-party software.

Modchips replace or override a system's hardware or software protection. They achieve this by either exploiting existing interfaces in an unintended or undocumented manner or by actively manipulating the system's internal communication, sometimes to the point of re-routing it to substitute parts provided by the Modchip.

Most of the Modchips consist of one or more integrated circuits (microcontrollers, FPGAs, or CPLDs), often complemented with discrete parts, usually packaged on a small PCB to fit within the console system it is originally designed for. Although there are Modchips that can be reprogrammed for different purposes, most of the Modchips are designed to work within only one console system or even only one specific hardware version.

Modchips typically require some degree of technical acumen to install since they must be connected to a console's circuitry, most commonly by soldering wires to select traces or chip legs on a system's circuit board. Some Modchips allow for installation by directly soldering the Modchip's contacts to the console's circuit ("quick solder"), by the precise positioning of electrical contacts ("solderless"). In rare cases, they can be plugged into a system's internal or external connector.

The diversity of hardware Modchips operates on varying methods. While Modchips are often used for the same goal, they may work in vastly different ways, even if they are intended for use on the same console. Some of the very first Modchips for the Nintendo Wii known as drive chips, modify the behavior and communication of the optical drive to bypass its security. While on the Xbox 360, a common Modchip took advantage of the fact short periods of instability in the CPU could be used to fairly reliably lead it to incorrectly compare security signatures. The precision required in this attack meant the Modchip made use of a CPLD. Other Modchips, such as the XenoGC and clones for the Nintendo GameCube, invoke a debug mode where security measures are reduced or absent, in this case, a stock Atmel AVR microcontroller was used. The most recent innovations are optical disk driven emulators or ODDE, these replace the optical disk drive and allow data to come from another source by bypassing the need to circumvent any security. These often make use of FPGAs to enable them to accurately emulate timing and performance characteristics of the optical drives.

### The Test Program
To check for correctness of your Modchip attack, you will use a simple test program, `test_program.hex`, that will run on the microcontroller.  This program will do the following:
 * Read the device ID of the Flash memory, print it to the UART, and verify it is correct.  If it is not correct, the program will halt.
 * Wait 1 second.
 * Read the 8-bit key from location ???? of the Flash memory, and print it to the UART.
 * If the key is the *USER* key (0x67), the program will print a message indicating it is entering user mode, and repeatedly print '-' to the UART.
 * If the key is the *ADMIN* key (0x00), the program will print a message indicating it is entering admin mode, and repeatedly print '+' to the UART.
 * If the key is the *SECRET* key (0xAA), the program will print a message indicating it is entering secret mode, and repeatedly print 'S' to the UART.

Because the program will read the device ID before reading the key, you will need to time your Modchip attack appropriately.  If you short the Modchip soldering point to ground too early, the device ID will be incorrect, and the program will halt.  If you short it too late, the program will have already read the key, and you will not be able to change it. 


### Flash Memory

Another objective of this lab is to gain experience interfacing with a SPI Flash memory.  The Flash memory on the board is a Winbond ??????.  The datasheet for this chip can be found in your *docs/* directory [here](https://github.com/byu-cpe/ecen522r_security_student/blob/main/docs/???.pdf).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Interacting with the Flash Memory
Print the device ID of the Flash memory to the UART. 

### Step 2: Writing the *USER* key to the Flash memory
Writing the *USER* key to the Flash memory

### Step 3: Easy Modchip Attack 
Enter the *ADMIN* mode by shorting the appropriate signal to ground.

### Step 4: Hard Modchip Attack
Enter the *SECRET* mode by connecting a signal generator to the appropriate signal and providing the *SECRET* key.
