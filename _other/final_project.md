===== Final Course Project =====


The project for this course is very open-ended. You can do anything you want, as long as it has something
to do with the course material. This might include:

  - Something related to FPGA CAD algorithms:
    * Implementing and evaluating a known algorithm
    * Comparing two or more existing algorithms
    * Improving an existing algorithm
    * Investigating the effects of various parameters on an algorithmâ€™s performance
    * Coming up with an entirely new algorithm to solve some problem
    * Applying an existing algorithm to a different problem
    * Investigating interactions between the target technology and a CAD tool
    * A theoretical analysis of some algorithm
  - Contribution to Open-Source CAD tools:
    * https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues
    * https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/issues
  - Accelerating an algorithm using the OpenCL tools
  - Something relating to the MPSoC material we covered:
    * Create a tutorial on generating a custom Linux image for the Ultra96 board.
    * Create benchmarks that demonstrate the performance of encryption with and without using the crypto hardware.


You can work alone, or in a group of 2.  As a rule-of-thumb, the level of difficulty
expected is: Number of people * level-of-difficulty-for-each-assignment * 2

==== Project Deliverables ====
There will be two deliverables for the project:

1. An interim class presentation on either April 13 or 15th. In this presentation, you will describe
the problem you are trying to solve, any relevant previous work, and your approach.  You should have some results to present.  Like the mini-lecture, your goal is to make sure that the class understands what you are tying to do, and why you are trying to do it.  Presentations should be close to 15 minutes.

2. The final technical report.  This should be prepared in IEEE conference format (10pt, two columns), with a 4 page limit.  The paper should be of similar writing quality to a IEEE conference paper.  Introduce your problem, Describe what you implemented, and include results.  Use figures where appropriate to help describe your project.  If your project is better presented in another format (jupyter notebook page, wiki page), discuss this with the instructor.


** The final report is due Wednesday, April 22th, 11:59pm **

==== Project Proposal ====
In order to ensure that everyone has a suitable project, I am asking you to email me a topic by March 27th. You should indicate the project title and the members of your group (if you are not working on your own). You should also write enough to convince me that the project is interesting, and is of a suitable difficulty.
