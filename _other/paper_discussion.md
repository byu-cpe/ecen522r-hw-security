# Under Construction

An important part of your career is being able to read a paper, or technical document, summarize it, and present the important points to an audience.  You will each give one min-lecture during the semester.

Each mini-presentations should be about 25 minutes long.  You can use power-point slides,
an overhead projector, or the white board, or a combination of all of these.


You will be evaluated on the following criteria: 
  * Presentation is well organized, and topics flow together
  * Sufficient background information is provided, and topic is well motivated.
  * Identifies key material, and provides meaningful substance without going into unnecessary details.
  * Presentation is engaging.
  * Presentation goes beyond just presenting the technical data; some useful examples, interactions or other content is connected to the technical material.
  * Appropriate level of depth and coverage of topic.
  * Handles questions and audience interaction well.
