Each student (as part of a group) will prepare a presentation and lead a class discussion about a research paper in the area of FPGA CAD and design tools.  The [Paper Reviews]({% link _pages/paper_reviews.md %}) page provides a list of papers we will read as a class, and schedule.

## Sign-Up

Sign up on Slack (see `#paper_review` channel), as a group of 2-3, to lead a paper discussion on a certain day.  *The entire schedule isn't available yet, so please sign up as it becomes available.*

## Collect Paper Reviews

Your group will be given access to a Google Drive folder where students will submit their individual paper reviews.  You don't need to submit a paper review for the week you are presenting.  Read the research paper thoroughly and review student comments in their paper reviews.  

## Prepare a Presentation

You should plan to spend about **40 minutes** leading a class discussion about the research paper.  In your presentation:
  1. Provide a summary/short lecture about the paper *(this can be prepared in advance)*:
     * Provide an overview 
     * Present the problem being solved
     * Summarize the solution presented in the paper
     * Mention how it fits with related work
  2. Lead a class discussion about the merits of the paper *(this will be prepared during the 24 hours between the paper review deadline and class)*:
     * Review pros and cons identified in student's "critical review" sections of their paper review
     * Organize items raised by students into logical categories, and facilitate a discussion on these items
   
Remember to:
  * Keep the presentation engaging.  Whenever possible, reduce text and include more graphics.  You can often include graphics and/or tables from the paper itself, but sometimes you may need to create some of your own.
  * Identify items from the paper that students indicated that they didn't understand, and try to address these items at some point in your presentation.

## Evaluation 

You will be evaluated on the following criteria: 
  * Organization and flow of presentation.
  * Effectiveness at summarizing the paper, and including the items mentioned above.
  * Identifing key material, and providing meaningful substance without going into unnecessary details.
  * Effectiveness at organizing students' critical review items, and leading class discussion on these items.
  * Keeping audience engaged.
  * Ability to address students' questions and concerns.
  * Appropriate length of time.
