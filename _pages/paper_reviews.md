An important part of this course is reading research papers.  There are two reasons for this: (1) only by reading research papers will you thoroughly understand many of the algorithms and techniques that we will talk about in class and (2) reading research papers properly takes practice, and is an important skill to develop, especially for those of you that go on to a research career.

## Paper Review Contents

Include the following in your paper review (in marked sections):
  1. A sentence or two giving an **overview** of the paper.
  1. Describe the **2-3 Major Contributions and/or Novelty** of the paper. This should be more than a re-statement of the abstract.  What do you think are the important contributions of the paper?
  1. Provide a **critical review, discussing several postive and negative aspects of the paper**.  Try to provide non-trivial arguments, including some points not brought up by the authors.  Do not summarize the paper (that's what the abstract is for); rather, evaluate the merits of the work done by the authors as presented in the paper. You could comment on things like: (not all in one review):
    *	importantance of the problem being solved
    *	soundness/correctness of approach
    *	appropriateness of methodology
    * quality, completeness or repeatability of results
    *	readability
    *	perspective and/or comparison with previous work
  1. Identify at least one aspect of the paper that you **didn't undertand**, or want to better understand.

Your review should be one page or less (normal fonts and margins).  Quality is more important than quantity.


## Class Discussion

For each of the paper reviews, we will have an [in-class discussion]({% link _other/paper_discussion.md %}).  Please come to class ready to discuss the paper.  If you are leading the class discussion, you don't have to submit a paper review that week. 

## Submission Instructions & Late Policy
See the `#paper_review` channel on Slack for submission links.

Because we discuss the paper reviews as a class, no late submissions will be accepted.  Please make sure to get your paper reviews in on time!
